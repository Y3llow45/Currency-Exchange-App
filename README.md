# Currency-Exchange-App
 Desktop app for currency exchange

## How to get started
1. Go to releases and download the .exe file.
2. Create an account at this <a href="https://app.exchangerate-api.com">website</a> ( it's free! ).
3. Go to the dashboard and copy "Example Request". It's going to look like this: https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/{api_key}/latest/USD.
4. Run the .exe and when the app opens, click on "Set API URL".
5. Inside the input field paste the url you copied in step 3 and click on the "Set API URL" button again.
6. Use the app.

## Notes
If you delete the .env and .json files, the app will create them again.
You have to enter the api url only once ( Unless you delete the .env file ).

## Upcomming updates
1. Let user choose how often data should be updated (10 mins, 1 min, 1 second). Anything less than 10 mins would require paid subscription at the api website.
2. Add custom themes
